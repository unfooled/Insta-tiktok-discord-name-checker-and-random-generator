# Insta-tiktok-discord-name-checker-and-random-generator
# uhhh i kinda "made" this name checker for some apps and plan on adding youtube and roblox 


## Most of its made by ai i know some people dont like idgaf most of the current script are outdated and dont work soo yea i made my own with ai cus im like that

## Some problems with the script il maybe fix maybe not:
 when script gives a error like bad proxy it wont show the error and you need to copy and paste on another typer to know the error(i think i fixed ts)
 Some times on the tik tok checker a name might say its available but it aint when you try to change to it thats because the account was deleted
 (wait for the username to be available (name get locked for 30 days)) (ONLY FOR THE TIK TOK ONE I THINK)

## Instagram checker features and uhh down sides
 You need a instagram account token (if you idk how to get that search it up fatass (sorry))
 you can check any name available
 can generate names like ug4h or hg_fj 
 Our you can add a prefir like og soo it makes:og45 or og_45
 if you get blocked by the instagram api i gives a cooldown to bypass
 No need for a proxy since instagram is chill like that fr

## Tik tok checker Features and uhh

 Same shit as the instagram one but you DONT need a cookie/token yay
 if the name says available and you try to put it and dosent go it cus the account was deleted and you have to wait 30 days to get the username or lower depends when the account was deleted
 and yea 

## Discord checker features and down sides ig
 discord api sucks and blocks you after like 3-4 seraches soo your better off with proxys yea
 has the same features as the instagram and tik tok
 has a no proxy version implemented but its gonna be a pain to search names
### :3 
## added roblox checker
has auto create account from: https://github.com/qing762/roblox-auto-signup credts

name checker
and webhook to know what are available
and others features from the other like generator

# UPDATEEEEEE

Updated so now the tik tok username checker works 

## NEW auto tik tok name claimer!!!

now you can "auto claim usernames" the script gets your session id/cookies that you can get by installing https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cookie-editor/hlkenndednhfkekhgcdicdfddnkalmdm and copying the json file to the txt file and the script ### is not made to spam request tik tok to chnage the user
What it does is emulates a broswer logs in see if the username is applyable and if not just skips to another username
### you can pair this with the tik tok username checker and on the webhook you put to send the users you get and on the new script you create a bot (the script has a step by step how to mkae one bot) andthe bot every 5s checks for new user the first script sends that are available and tries to claim them on your broswer

## YOU NEED CHROME INSTALLED BTW
